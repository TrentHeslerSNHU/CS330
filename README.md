# CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization
## How do I approach designing software?
I try to approach designing software in a very modular and scalable fashion. I like to create systems at the outset that allow me to efficiently carry out
the work needed to complete the project.

While a good chunk of the code for this project was provided for us, it was organized into modules in much the same way that I would have organized it:
I would have designed one module for creating the various shape meshes needed for this project, a module for handling the lighting, another module for 
handling the view/camera, and, lastly, a module for constructing the scene and arranging the objects.

Once this framework is developed, the rest of the project can be carried out in a smooth and efficient manner.

## How do I approach developing programs?
As I said above, I like to keep things modular and establish frameworks to streamline development. This was very helpful with regards to this project.
Once I had a system in mind, I was able to iteratively create the code for each object within the scene, following the same or similar steps for each.
I knew that anticipating future requirements and establishing a solid framework initially would save me time in the end, as there would be less rework necessary.
This allowed me to focus on solely developing the code necessary for each module/milestone, instead of having to reinvent the wheel each time.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
While I'm still unsure about what subfield of Computer Science I want to work in professionally, I am very grateful to have taken this class!
Video games served as the catalyst for my interest in the field of Computer Science, and I've always had a desire to understand how developers created
the 3D worlds I explored throughout my childhood!
Also, as we learned through our readings and discussions in this course, computational graphics and visualizations are not just the domain of video game developers.
Many other fields require the skills we learned in this course.
Whether I end up doing work with computer graphics professionally or not, this is something I plan to explore further in my spare time. I have always wanted to dabble with
developing a 3D game, and now I have the skills to do so!
